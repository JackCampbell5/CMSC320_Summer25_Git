Q1: Why might we consider using Git?

Answer: To help keep track of project process, to publish a project, to work on code with a collaborative team. Git gives an incredible record of progress for a project with detailed changes. This allows us to rollback problematic changes if necessary and be very clear with everyone exactly what code is finalized. 

Q2: What field could data science be applied to? Give an Example.

Answer: Sports is a great location for data science to be applied to especially in football. You can keep track of many different stats for the player such as speed, running yards, passing yards, playing time. This would allow you to compare them against other players and see where they can improve for a future game.

Q3: What is the difference between Merging and Rebasing?

Answer: Merging sometimes adds a commit and combines changes from another branch into your current branch. Rebasing does not add a commit and adds everything to the start of your current branch by adding all new commits to the tip of the current branch. It then updates all commits in your current branch to match. Merging preserves the history of the code while rebasing rewrites history but may be more clean in some cases. 


Q4: What are you looking forward to this semester?

Answer: Learning more about efficient data science as I do a lot with data in spreadsheets but know I am not being computationally efficient with it at all. I also want to learn how storing data in a database works as I know there are intricacies that save time. I am finally looking forward to coding in Python as I have been using a lot of JavaScript lately which is not as fun.
